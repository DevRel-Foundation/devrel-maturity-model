# Community

In the context of Developer Relations, Community is a group of individuals—developers, users, contributors, and enthusiasts—who share common interests, goals, or usage of a specific technology or product.

A healthy community fosters peer-to-peer support, collaboration, and knowledge sharing, extending the value of a product beyond its core features.
