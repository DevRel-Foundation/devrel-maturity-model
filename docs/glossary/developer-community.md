A community is a group of people who come together online or in-person because they share a common interest, goal, or trait. A developer community is a community that forms around a specific technology or product that is used by software developers.

People may seek community for peer-to-peer recommendations and support, collaboration on achieving outcomes, sharing knowledge, extending the original technology, or purely a sense of belonging.
