# Developer Advocate

A Developer Advocate is a technical role that acts as a bridge between the developer community and an organization's internal engineering and product teams.

Their primary responsibility is to enable developers to be successful with a platform or tool while advocating for the developer's needs internally. This involves creating technical content, gathering feedback, and helping to improve the developer experience.
