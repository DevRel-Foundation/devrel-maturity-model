term: Developer Experience
version: 1.0.0
---

Developer Experience is the user experience of a technology, product, or service where the user is a software developer.

The experience of an individual in the adoption and use of a technology is important to Developer Relations because friction that prevents the realization of value is an obstacle or barrier to a successful outcome for the organization.

It is also common for this term to be used to indicate the collective experience of software developers internal to an organization with the set of tools used in the production of a software product. This is not the meaning typically used within the context of DevRel.

Commonly abbreviated as DX or DevEx.

Contributors to a positive developer experience include well designed and intuitive APIs, comprehensive and accurate documentation, ease of use with developer tools (Client SDKs, CLIs), and a welcoming community with support.
