# Developer Experience (DX)

Developer Experience (DX) is the sum of all interactions a developer has with a product, platform, or organization.

It is the equivalent of User Experience (UX) but for technical users. Good DX encompasses intuitive APIs, comprehensive documentation, reliable tools (SDKs, CLIs), efficient support, and a welcoming community, all aimed at minimizing friction and maximizing developer success and satisfaction.
