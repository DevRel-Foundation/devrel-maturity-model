# Developer Evangelist

A Developer Evangelist is a role focused on outreach and promotion, using technical knowledge to inspire and educate developers about a product or platform.

While similar to a Developer Advocate, an Evangelist often focuses more on awareness and adoption through public speaking, content creation, and events, aiming to get developers excited about what they can build.
