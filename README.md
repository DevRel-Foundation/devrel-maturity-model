# DevRel Maturity Model

The definition and tactics of Developer Relations has a high degree of variance across organizations. It is our belief that this is a reflection on the maturity of the practice and structure of the roles and organization. The **DevRel Maturity Model** project aims to provide canonical definitions to the terminology, structure, organization, and tactics of Developer Relations programs.
